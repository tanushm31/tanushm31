- 👋 Hi, I’m @tanushm31
- 💞️ I’m a believer of the paradigm that technology and innovation can help people in amazing ways and I want to contribute to the cause.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things including machine learning, cybersecurity, game development etc. But I believe that building new ideas and prototyping are my strong suit since I have a natural instinct for finding and executing new features and how that could benefit sections of population. 
- 🌱 I’m currently practicing DSA & learning about Data Science and related tools.
- 📫 You can reach me at my email at - tanush.mohina@gmail.com
